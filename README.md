## *Automating Infrastructure Deployment on Azure Cloud With Terraform and Azure Pipeline*

The dynamism and evolving landscape of cloud computing has made organization to constantly seek ways to streamline and automate their infrastructure deployment process. Azure cloud with its robust set of services, provides environment for such endeavours. One powerful combination that has gained popularity is the use of Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) and Azure Pipeline for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

## *What are Infrastructures?*

Infrastructures simply put are resources on which application runs on

## *Terraform as the Foundation*

Terraform, an open-source IaC tool, allows organizations to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative manner. With Terraform, infrastructure is defined as code using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), enabling teams to manage their resources, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks, in a version-controlled and reproducible manner. This shift to codifying infrastructure brings consistency and scalability to deployment processes.
